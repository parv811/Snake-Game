# Snake-Game
## My First Unity Project
 	It is an endless game where each fruit consumed by snake will give 1 point to user.
	You can control the movement of sanke using W,A,S,D keys.
 
	I made this game using basic Unity components like Sprite Renderer, RigidBoddy2D and BoxCollider2D.
	I've also used some basic Unity Scripting functions like Instantiate, Start, Awake, Update and FixedUpdate.
